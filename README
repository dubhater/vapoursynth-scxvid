Scene change detection plugin for VapourSynth, using xvid.

Converted from the Avisynth plugin written by Fredrik Mellbin.

To compile in Linux (and possibly other Unix-like systems):
clang -shared -fPIC -o libscxvid.so scxvid.c -lxvidcore

Currently only tested in Linux.

There is now a win32 dll in the Downloads section.
